These conventional resources represent only a part of the natural gas that's available to us. 

00:06.000 --> 00:13.000
Natural gas also occurs in places that are more difficult to develop and more expensive to produce. 

00:13.000 --> 00:23.000
These occurrences known as unconventional resources include tight gas, coalbed methane, deep gas, and methane hydrates. 

00:23.000 --> 00:29.000
Together these have the potential of providing large amounts of natural gas for the future.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Tight gas occurs in rocks like the massive sandstones that form the cliffs of Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado. 

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
Farther south these same layers lie buried beneath thousands of feet of rock in the San Juan Basin. 

00:47.000 --> 00:57.000
Here they house vast stores of natural gas but hold it tightly locked in isolated cells. 

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
Pores in these tight gas reservoirs are unconnected like holes in a Swiss cheese or linked only by microscopic cracks. 

01:07.000 --> 01:14.000
The gas moves slowly through the rock or not at all, making it difficult to collect, 

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
but large natural fractures crack open the pore space, freeing the gas.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Zones of intensely fractured rock form concentrations of natural gas. 

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
New technologies let drillers pierce these zones horizontally, 

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
tapping several from a single well and making the difficult job of recovery more efficient.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000
Tight gas sandstones hold immense quantities of natural gas, 

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
but much of it may be too expensive or even impossible to recover, 

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
yet reasoned estimates suggest that tight gas might supply four hundred trillion cubic feet of natural gas, 

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
enough to meet our present needs for twenty years.
