## Synopsis

crudTest is a small application to study Angular, PHP and MySQL interaction.

## Features
- Complete test of create, read, update and delete operations in an Angular web app.
- Totally stripped out, minimal in all ways: 
    - no styling frameworks (eg Foundation or Bootstrap);
    - no jQuery;
    - no PHP frameworks;
    - no additional JavaScript;
    - no CSS.
- Angular used for client-side MVC, PHP confined to database operations.
- Small and simple initial test database.
- PDO invocations with literally-named preparations used throughout.
- Apache 2.4.9, MySQL Server 5.6.17, PHP 5.5.12, Angular 1.4.8.
- Developed on a WAMP stack under Windows 7.
- Should be portable to other platforms and PDO-supported database servers.

## Preconditions for demonstration
- Installed WAMP/LAMP/MAMP stack 
- Internet access for content delivery of Angular framework.
- Restore database backup file crudTest/notes/dump_of_application_database.sql
